# The Jarles' Proprietary Google Knockoff: **Jargle**

## The Project:

This is a small project for [The Odin Project's](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css "Web Development 101, Project: HTML/CSS")
introductory course on web development, Web Development 101. In this project I'm
creating a web-page, that resembles Google's homepage, using **HTML** and
**CSS**. 

Note that any sort of actual functionaly is beyond this project's
scope, this exercise is only to practice the aforementioned languages.

## Learning Goals:

By the end of this project I hope to know the basics or be better at:

* HTML
* CSS
* Using the built-in developer tools of Firefox
* Git
* General HTML structuring
* CSS debugging

## What I Learned:

A short, non-exhaustive list of what I learned during the course of this
project:

* Basic markdown syntax
* Better understanding of CSS
* Better understanding of the CSS box-model
* Much better understanding of using/finding stuff in the inspector
* Better understanding of HTML

## Last Words

I feel I've barely begun scratching the surface of front-end development but I've also learned quite a bit. I'm really satisfied with how the page turned out in the end.
